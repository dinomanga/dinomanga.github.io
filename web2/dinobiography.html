	<h1>Backstory of Dino-kun</h1>
	
	<img src="profilepic.jpg" alt="Dino-Kun Avatar" width="250" height="200">
	
	<p>I've started to draw when I was very young. Drawing has been one of my favorite things to do in life other than playing games, watching Anime and thinking about food.</p>
	
	<h2>Family</h2>
	
	<p>I was born on April 20 2000 in Baltimore, Maryland. Like my siblings before and after me, I was given a multiple nicknames; one of them being Dino.</p>
	
		<h3>Family</h3>
		
		<p>I am the third youngest child in a family of six and also the youngest male. I have a mother, a father, two older brothers and a little sister.</p>
	
		<h3>OCs to Series</h3>
	
		<p>As a kid, I would create weird and interesting comics/illustrations. For example, I drew Spongebob as a Pokemon Trainer and as Mario. I even made a Sonic OC; I named him Malcolm the Hedgehog and if your a die hard Sonic fan, you might assume that he's a mix between Sonic, Shadow and Scrouge. When I was a preteen, I thought about making Malcolm into a human...like in an Anime like style. This idea was interesting, little did I know that it would change my life...or rather what I want to do in life. During High School, I started to create my characters in an Anime style of my liking, which inspired me to create my own Anime/Manga series. </p>
