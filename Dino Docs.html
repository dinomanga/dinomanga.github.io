	<h1>Within the Mind of Dino-kun</h1>
	
	<p>Hey there! Welcome to Dino Docs! This portfolio is created so viewers can get to know me more as a person.</p>
	
	<h2>Career</h2>
	
	<p>My goal in life is to become a graphic artist</p>
	
		<h3>Working Manga/Comic</h3>
		
		<p>I am currently working on my own shounen manga series and hope to create a franchise</p>
	
		<h3>Inspiration</h3>
	
		<p>Various manga and anime like Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto, My Hero Academia and many more have inspired me to create my own shounen series. Over more than a decade, my drawing style has improved greatly from stick figures to anime style drawing. When it comes to my drawing style, both Dragon Ball and My Hero Academia provides a major influence when comes to creating facial expressions and clothes.  </p>
